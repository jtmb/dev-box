## Features

- 🐧 Ubuntu 24.04 base image
- ⚙️ Pre-installed: Ansible, Terraform, Vault, Python, Git, and more
- 🖥️ User-friendly launcher with menu-driven actions
- 💾 Persistent home directory via Docker volume
- 🧑‍💻 Devcontainer support for VS Code integration
- 🎨 Customizable shell themes and aliases
- 🔒 Secure secrets and SSH directory setup
- 🐳 Docker-in-Docker support (optional)
- 🦸 Includes dev-tricks - a custom built devops menu-driven TUI for dev-box
- 📏 240 MB docker image size
- 😜 NEW* Includes cheeky startup messages. (Can be disabled in config.)



## Architecture

- 📦 **Dockerfile**: Builds the base image with all required tools and user setup
- 📝 **docker-compose.yml**: Defines the container service, volumes, and environment
- 🧑‍💻 **.devcontainer/**: VS Code devcontainer configuration for remote development
- 🖥️ **launcher.sh**: Interactive menu for common tasks (IP display, setup, themes, etc.) **in progress**
- 🏁 **docker-init.sh**: Container entrypoint for user, permissions, and environment setup
- 📁 **/src**: Place for additional scripts, images, or resources



## Setup


### Prerequisites
- 🐳 Docker & Docker Compose installed
- 💻 (Optional) Visual Studio Code with Remote - Containers extension


### Quick Start

```sh
./compose-up.sh
```
This will build the image, start the container, and drop you into a shell as the `ubuntu` user. 🐧

Or build manually:
```sh
docker compose up --build -d # build the stack
docker exec -it dev-box bash # exec into the dev-box container interactive bash shell
```


### VS Code Devcontainer

Open the folder in VS Code and reopen in container for a full-featured development environment. 🦾



## Usage: dev-tricks-launcher

`dev-tricks-launcher.sh` is a menu-driven TUI (Text User Interface) tool designed to simplify common DevOps and development tasks inside the dev-box container. It provides a convenient, interactive way to access system information, manage tools, and perform routine operations without memorizing commands. 🤓

**Key Features:**
- 🌐 View local and public IP addresses
- 🖥️ Check system info and disk usage
- 📡 Run network tests
- 🔍 View Git status
- 🏹 Ping Ansible inventory
- 🏦 Check Vault status
- 🛠️ Show tool versions (Terraform, Ansible, Vault, Git)
- 🧹 Clear Terraform cache or Bash history
- 🔄 Reload the shell environment

</div>


**Usage:**

To launch the Dev-Tricks TUI, simply type:

```sh
launcher
```

Or run the script directly:

```sh
src/dev-tricks-launcher.sh
```

🕹️ Follow the on-screen menu to select and execute actions.



## Troubleshooting

- 🐳 If the container fails to start, ensure Docker is running and you have permission to access the Docker socket.
- 🔑 For permission issues, rerun `docker-init.sh` or check volume mounts.
- ♻️ To rebuild from scratch:
  ```sh
  docker rm -f dev-box
  docker image rm dev-box:latest
  ./compose-up.sh
  ```
